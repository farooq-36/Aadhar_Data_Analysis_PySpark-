passport holders of India and resident foreign nationals who have spent over 182 days in twelve months immediately
preceding the date of application for enrolment, based on their biometric and demographic data.

The data refers to daily count of Total Aadhaar Generated, Enrolment Applications Rejected by state and district. 
Count is reflecting only the last updated date data. State and District information is collected from the information provided by Resident

confirms approval or rejection  of enrolment application. The date for which the details on count refers to has been mentioned in the file name.
